## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Will I lose my typed data if my session times out while I am serving a customer?
**Answer:** No. The workbench automatically saves your unsubmitted form entries as **Drafts**. When you log back in or re-authenticate your session, your active tabs and typed form data are restored automatically.

### Q2: Why is a specific menu option missing from my left navigation sidebar?
**Answer:** Sidebar menus are dynamically filtered based on your assigned Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions. If a menu option is missing, your User ID is not assigned the required role permission. Request permission elevation from your Branch Manager.

### Q3: What should I do if a printed report or voucher cuts off text on the right side?
**Answer:** Ensure your printer paper size is set to **A4 Standard (8.27 × 11.69 inches)** and printer scale is set to **100% Fit to Printable Area** in the browser print dialog.

### Q4: How do I pop out a form to a second monitor screen?
**Answer:** Open the desired screen tab, then click the **Pop-Out Window** icon located on the top right toolbar of the card container.
