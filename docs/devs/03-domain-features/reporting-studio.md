# 📊 Reporting Studio & Viewer Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary & Purpose
This document specifies the architecture, report line designer, and viewer subsystem of the Reporting domain in `finx-ui` located at [src/features/reporting/](file:///d:/CBS/In_house/finx/finxui-ref/src/features/reporting).

Reporting enables banking officers to view daily ledger summaries, transaction journals, close-of-business (COB) audit logs, and configure custom financial report layouts.
